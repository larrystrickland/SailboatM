<h2>Plotted Objects</h2>

<h3>Managing Plotted objects</h3>

<h3>Rotate View</h3>
<p>To rotate the view, drag the rotate view slider.  This can be very slow if lots of data is loaded.  Ideally, just load a small amount of data, orient the view, then load the rest of the data</p>
<h3>Annimate</h3>
<p>The boats paths can be annimated, but adjusting the start and finish times on the bottom slider, then clicking on start annimation button</p>
<p>The textbox has a time multiplier in it, increaseing this speeds up the annimation, making it negative, causes the boat paths to go backwards.</p>
